# SAIDL-Assignment
This is my submission repository for SAiDL Assignment

The comparisions for Section 1 are present in the file Section1.pdf
Additionally, I have also uploaded my VGG16 architecture model of CIFAR100 (using normal softmax) - CIFAR100_vgg16.ipynb. But for comparison purpose of the assignment, I have uploaded 2 other Jupyter Notebooks using AlexNet architecture - CIFAR100_AlexNet.ipynb and CIFAR100_AlexNet_with_Gumbel_softmax.ipynb

I could not start until after compres and am still working on the other assignments. I will upload them as soon as I am done with them.
