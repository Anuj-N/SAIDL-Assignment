# SAIDL-Assignment
This is my submission repository for SAiDL Assignment

CIFAR100_AlexNet.ipynb and CIFAR100_AlexNet_with_Gumbel_softmax.ipynb: For comparison purpose of the Section 1, I have uploaded 2 other Jupyter Notebooks using AlexNet architecture

Section1.pdf: The comparisions for Section 1 are present in this file

CIFAR100_vgg16.ipynb: Additionally, I have also uploaded my VGG16 architecture model of CIFAR100 (using normal softmax) of around 60% test set accuracy after 20 training epochs 

I'm sorry but I honestly could not start this assignment until after compres and am still working on the other projects. I will upload them on this repository as soon as I am done with them.
